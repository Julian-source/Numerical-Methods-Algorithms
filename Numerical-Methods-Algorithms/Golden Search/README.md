This algorithm finds the input value of a function where the function is at its minimum using the golden ratio                  search method.
The inputs for this algorithm include func (function that is being evaluated), xl (lower bound of x bracket), xu (upper bound of x bracket), and eb (error bound).
This algorithm's outputs xmin (the x value when the function is at its minimum), fmin (the minimum value of the function), ea (approximate relative error), and iter (number of iterations to solve).
