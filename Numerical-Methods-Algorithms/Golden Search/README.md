Description: This algorithm finds the input value of a function where the function is at a minimum using the golden ratio                  search method. 
Outputs: xmin - x value when function is minimum
         fmin - the minimum value of the function
         ea   - approximate relative error
         iter - number of iterations to solve
Inputs : func - function that is being evaluated
         xl   - lower bound of x bracket
         xu   - upper bound of x bracket
         eb   - error bound
