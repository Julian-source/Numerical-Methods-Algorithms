This algorithm finds the root of a function using the newton raphson method to an approcimate relative error specified by the user.
The inputs of this algorithm include func (the function being evaluated), xi (the initial guess of the root), and eb (the error bound).
The initial guess of the root can not be at a min or max of the function.  The outputs of the algorithm are root (the estimated root of the funtion),
ea (the approximate relative error), and iter (the number of iterations the algorithm took to solve).
